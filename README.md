## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming

### Compilation

To compile the project, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp BankAccount.cpp BankSystem.cpp Transaction.cpp -o bank_system
```

### Running the Application

After compiling, run the application using the following command:

```bash
./bank_system
